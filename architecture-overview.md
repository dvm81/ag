# MRMC Agent Bot: Architecture & Design Documentation

## Executive Summary for Non-Technical Audience

### The Problem We're Solving

Imagine you're a bank with hundreds of AI models making critical decisions - approving loans, detecting fraud, assessing risk. Regulators require detailed documentation for each model explaining:
- **What** the model does
- **How** it makes decisions  
- **What data** it uses
- **How** it's monitored
- **Who** is responsible

Creating this documentation manually takes weeks per model and becomes outdated quickly. 

### Our Solution: The MRMC Agent Bot

Think of our solution as a **smart documentation assistant** that:
1. **Reads** your code like a senior engineer would
2. **Understands** what your model does by analyzing the actual implementation
3. **Writes** compliance documentation automatically
4. **Integrates** with your existing development tools (VS Code, GitHub)
5. **Updates** documentation as code changes

### How It Works (Simple Analogy)

It's like having a skilled technical writer who:
- Can read and understand code in any programming language
- Knows exactly what regulators need to see
- Never gets tired or makes mistakes
- Works 24/7 and updates docs instantly when code changes

## Technical Architecture Overview

### System Design Philosophy

The MRMC Agent Bot follows an **agent-based architecture** inspired by Claude Code, where specialized AI agents collaborate using purpose-built tools to understand and document model implementations.

## Detailed Component Explanation

### 1. The Orchestrator Agent (The Conductor)

**What it does:** Acts as the project manager, coordinating all other agents and ensuring they work together efficiently.

**How it works:**
```python
# Simplified conceptual flow
orchestrator = OrchestatorAgent()

# 1. Analyzes repository structure
repo_analysis = orchestrator.initial_scan(repo_path)

# 2. Delegates to specialized agents
purpose = await purpose_agent.analyze(repo_analysis)
inputs = await inputs_agent.discover(repo_analysis)
methodology = await methodology_agent.extract(repo_analysis)
implementation = await implementation_agent.examine(repo_analysis)
usage = await usage_agent.determine(repo_analysis)

# 3. Combines findings into cohesive document
document = orchestrator.synthesize(
    purpose, inputs, methodology, implementation, usage
)
```

**Key Features:**
- Parallel processing of independent sections
- Intelligent retry on failures
- Cross-validation between agent findings
- Conflict resolution when agents disagree

### 2. Specialized Agents (The Expert Team)

Each agent is an expert in one compliance area:

#### Purpose Agent (The Business Analyst)
**Mission:** Understand WHY the model exists

**Tools Used:**
- `git_history`: "Show me how this project evolved"
- `docs_reader`: "What does the README say?"
- `code_search`: "Find main() or entry points"

**Discovers:**
- Business problem being solved
- Target users and stakeholders
- Frequency of execution (daily/weekly/on-demand)
- Business impact and criticality

#### Inputs Agent (The Data Detective)
**Mission:** Find ALL data sources

**Tools Used:**
- `ast_analyzer`: "Parse data loading code"
- `config_reader`: "Find data configuration files"
- `code_search`: "Find SQL queries, API calls, file reads"

**Discovers:**
- Data sources (files, databases, APIs)
- Data validation rules
- Quality checks
- Data transformations

#### Methodology Agent (The Algorithm Expert)
**Mission:** Understand HOW the model works

**Tools Used:**
- `ast_analyzer`: "Find model class definitions"
- `test_analyzer`: "Understand expected behavior"
- `config_reader`: "Extract hyperparameters"

**Discovers:**
- Algorithm type (Random Forest, Neural Network, etc.)
- Model parameters and their values
- Training/calibration procedures
- Performance metrics

#### Implementation Agent (The Systems Architect)
**Mission:** Document the technical implementation

**Tools Used:**
- `dependency_analyzer`: "What libraries are used?"
- `code_search`: "Find deployment configurations"
- `git_history`: "Who maintains this code?"

**Discovers:**
- Programming languages and frameworks
- Deployment environment
- Integration points
- Error handling

#### Usage Agent (The Operations Expert)
**Mission:** Explain how the model is USED and MONITORED

**Tools Used:**
- `code_search`: "Find logging and monitoring code"
- `test_analyzer`: "Find usage examples"
- `config_reader`: "Find alert thresholds"

**Discovers:**
- Monitoring metrics and KPIs
- Alert thresholds
- Usage instructions
- Change management procedures

### 3. The Tool Suite (The Swiss Army Knife)

Each tool is a specialized capability:

```python
# Example: Code Search Tool
@tool
def code_search(pattern: str, file_types: List[str]) -> List[CodeMatch]:
    """
    Searches repository for specific patterns.
    Like grep, but understands code structure.
    """
    results = []
    for file in repository.files(types=file_types):
        if pattern in file.content:
            results.append(CodeMatch(
                file=file.path,
                line=file.line_number,
                context=file.surrounding_code
            ))
    return results

# Example: AST Analyzer Tool
@tool
def ast_analyzer(file_path: str) -> CodeStructure:
    """
    Parses code into Abstract Syntax Tree.
    Understands code structure, not just text.
    """
    tree = parse_code(file_path)
    return CodeStructure(
        classes=tree.find_classes(),
        functions=tree.find_functions(),
        imports=tree.find_imports(),
        variables=tree.find_variables()
    )
```

### 4. Integration Methods

## Why This Approach is Superior

### 1. Intelligent vs. Template-Based

**Traditional Approach:**
- Fill in blanks in a template
- Misses context and nuance
- Requires manual updates

**Agent-Based Approach:**
- Actively explores and understands code
- Adapts to different coding styles
- Self-updates with code changes

### 2. Tool-Based Discovery vs. RAG

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):**
- Searches for similar text
- Can hallucinate connections
- Limited by indexed content

**Tool-Based Discovery:**
- Executes specific analysis tasks
- Returns structured, factual data
- Always accurate to current code

### 3. Multi-Agent Collaboration

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Single Agent"
        SA[Monolithic Agent] -->|"Does everything"| OUT1[Output]
    end
    
    subgraph "Multi-Agent System"
        A1[Purpose Expert] -->|"Purpose section"| COMBINE[Orchestrator]
        A2[Data Expert] -->|"Inputs section"| COMBINE
        A3[Algorithm Expert] -->|"Methodology section"| COMBINE
        A4[Systems Expert] -->|"Implementation section"| COMBINE
        A5[Operations Expert] -->|"Usage section"| COMBINE
        COMBINE -->|"Complete document"| OUT2[Output]
    end
```

**Benefits:**
- Parallel processing (5x faster)
- Specialized expertise per section
- Better error isolation
- Easier to debug and improve

## Technical Innovation Highlights

### 1. Semantic Code Understanding
Not just pattern matching, but true comprehension:
- Understands variable flow through program
- Recognizes design patterns
- Infers business logic from code structure

### 2. Adaptive Prompting
Prompts evolve based on discoveries:
```python
if agent.finds_tensorflow():
    prompt.add_context("Deep learning model detected")
    prompt.add_questions(["What layers?", "What optimizer?"])
elif agent.finds_sklearn():
    prompt.add_context("Traditional ML model detected")
    prompt.add_questions(["What algorithm?", "Cross-validation?"])
```

### 3. Confidence Scoring
Each section includes confidence metrics:
```json
{
  "section": "Model Inputs",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "evidence": [
    "Found 3 data loading functions",
    "Config file specifies 5 data sources",
    "Tests validate 10 input features"
  ],
  "gaps": [
    "Could not determine data refresh frequency"
  ]
}
```
