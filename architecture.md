# MRMC Agent Bot: Complete Architecture Documentation

## Executive Summary for Non-Technical Audience

### The Problem We're Solving

Imagine you're a bank with hundreds of AI models making critical decisions - approving loans, detecting fraud, assessing risk. Regulators require detailed documentation for each model explaining:
- **What** the model does
- **How** it makes decisions  
- **What data** it uses
- **How** it's monitored
- **Who** is responsible

Creating this documentation manually takes weeks per model and becomes outdated quickly. 

### Our Solution: The MRMC Agent Bot

Think of our solution as a **smart documentation assistant** that:
1. **Reads** your code like a senior engineer would
2. **Understands** what your model does by analyzing the actual implementation
3. **Writes** compliance documentation automatically using AI reasoning
4. **Integrates** with your existing development tools (VS Code, GitHub)
5. **Updates** documentation as code changes

### How It Works (Simple Analogy)

It's like having a skilled technical writer who:
- Can read and understand code in any programming language
- Uses advanced AI to reason about what the code actually does
- Knows exactly what regulators need to see
- Never gets tired or makes mistakes
- Works 24/7 and updates docs instantly when code changes

## Integration with Model Governance Workflow

The MRMC Agent Bot is not a standalone solution but a critical component within a comprehensive model governance framework. For detailed workflow documentation, see [model-governance-workflow.md](./model-governance-workflow.md).

### Governance Context

    BOT --> REVIEW
    REVIEW --> IMMAT
    IMMAT --> KPI
    
    style BOT fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```

The MRMC Bot receives enriched inputs from:
- **Model Inventory**: Business context, ownership, governance tier
- **Risk Assessment**: Inherent risk rating, compliance requirements

And provides outputs for:
- **Human Review**: Draft documentation for validation
- **Immateriality Assessment**: Model complexity insights
- **KPI Generation**: Suggested performance metrics

## Architecture Evolution: From Pattern Matching to AI Reasoning

### 🚀 The Great Architecture Transformation

We fundamentally transformed the MRMC Agent Bot from a **pattern-matching system** to an **intelligent LLM-based reasoning system**. This addresses the critical insight: _"Why hardcode patterns when we can use AI to understand code semantically?"_

#### Before: Hardcoded Pattern Matching
```python
# OLD APPROACH - Brittle pattern matching
if "StandardScaler" in code:
    return "Feature standardization detected"
if "RandomForestClassifier" in code:
    return "Random Forest model detected"
# Hundreds of hardcoded patterns...
```

**Problems:**
- Brittle and incomplete
- Missed context and nuance
- Required constant maintenance
- Couldn't adapt to new frameworks

#### After: LLM-Based Reasoning
```python
# NEW APPROACH - AI reasoning with context
llm_response = await llm_service.reason_about_code(
    section_context=mrmc_requirements,
    tool_results=code_analysis,
    specific_prompt=section_specific_guidance
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Understands intent, not just syntax
- Adapts to any framework or pattern
- Provides reasoning chains
- Self-improving through better prompts

## Current LLM-Enhanced Architecture

### System Design Philosophy

The MRMC Agent Bot follows an **intelligent agent-based architecture** where specialized AI agents collaborate using purpose-built tools and advanced language models to understand and document model implementations.

**How It Works:**
1. **Tools** gather factual evidence from code
2. **LLM** reasons about evidence for MRMC compliance
3. **Agents** structure findings into proper documentation
4. **Orchestrator** coordinates and validates complete document

---

## Detailed Component Architecture

### 1. LLM Service Layer (The Brain)

**Purpose**: Central reasoning engine that transforms raw tool data into compliance insights

```python
class LLMService:
    async def reason_about_code(
        self,
        section_context: str,      # MRMC section requirements
        tool_results: Dict,         # Evidence from tools
        specific_prompt: str        # Agent-specific guidance
    ) -> LLMResponse
```

**Key Features:**
- Configurable LLM backend (OpenAI, Claude, local models)
- Section-specific prompting strategies
- Confidence scoring and reasoning tracking
- Token usage monitoring
- Caching for repeated analysis

**Section-Specific Prompting:**
```python
SECTION_PROMPTS = {
    "purpose": """
    You are analyzing code to understand the business purpose of an ML model.
    Focus on: business objectives, use cases, stakeholders, decision context.
    Look for patterns that indicate: problem domain, success criteria, user impact.
    """,
    "methodology": """
    You are analyzing code to understand the technical methodology of an ML model.
    Focus on: algorithms, parameters, training approach, performance metrics.
    Look for patterns that indicate: model architecture, validation strategy, metrics.
    """
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Specialized Agents (The Expert Team)

Each agent follows the new **Tool → LLM → Structure** pattern:

```python
class SpecializedAgent(BaseAgent):
    async def analyze(self, repo_path: str) -> AgentResult:
        # Step 1: Gather evidence using tools
        tool_results = await self._gather_evidence(repo_path)
        
        # Step 2: Use LLM to reason about evidence
        llm_response = await self.llm_service.reason_about_code(
            section_context=self._get_section_context(),
            tool_results=tool_results,
            specific_prompt=self._get_analysis_prompt()
        )
        
        # Step 3: Structure findings into MRMC format
        return AgentResult(data=llm_response.content, ...)
```

When no metrics are detected in code, the system:
1. **Analyzes Model Type** → Determines if classification/regression/clustering
2. **Proposes Appropriate Metrics** → Suggests 2-3 relevant metrics
3. **Provides Rationale** → Explains why these metrics matter

Example:
```python

result = await orchestrator.analyze(repo_path, context={})
document = result.data  # MRMCDocument object
```

### 4. The Enhanced Tool Suite

```python
class PythonASTAnalyzer(BaseTool):
    async def execute(self, repo_path: str) -> ToolResult:
        # Returns structured data about:
        return {
            "models": [ModelInfo(...)],
            "performance_info": ModelPerformanceInfo(...),

            "context": surrounding_code,
            "confidence": 0.92
        }
```

#### Config Reader (Configuration Parser)
```python

        return {
            "hyperparameters": {...},
            "data_sources": [...],
            "thresholds": [...],
            "confidence": 0.85
        }
```

## Technical Innovation Highlights

### 1. Semantic Code Understanding
Not just pattern matching, but true AI-powered comprehension:
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: LLM understands variable flow through program
- **Pattern Recognition**: Recognizes design patterns and architectural decisions
- **Intent Inference**: Infers business logic from code structure
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Correlates findings across multiple evidence sources

### 2. Adaptive AI Prompting
Prompts evolve based on discoveries:
```python
if agent.finds_tensorflow():
    prompt.add_context("Deep learning model detected")
    prompt.add_questions(["What layers?", "What optimizer?", "What loss function?"])
elif agent.finds_sklearn():
    prompt.add_context("Traditional ML model detected")
    prompt.add_questions(["What algorithm?", "Cross-validation approach?", "Feature engineering?"])
```

### 3. Intelligent Performance Metrics Proposal
When no metrics found, AI reasons about appropriate metrics:
```python
# AI determines model type and proposes metrics
model_type = llm_service.classify_model_type(tool_results)
proposed_metrics = llm_service.propose_metrics(
    model_type=model_type,
    business_context=business_context,
    regulatory_requirements=mrmc_requirements
)
```

### 4. Confidence Scoring with Evidence Chains
Each section includes AI-generated confidence metrics:
```json
{
  "section": "Model Methodology",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "reasoning_chain": [
    "Found RandomForestClassifier instantiation",
    "Identified n_estimators=100, max_depth=10",
    "Located accuracy_score and f1_score usage",
    "AI inferred ensemble learning approach with validation"
  ],
  "evidence": [
    "Code analysis: 3 model classes found",
    "Config analysis: Hyperparameters detected",
    "LLM reasoning: Algorithm classification confirmed"
  ],
  "gaps": [
    "Cross-validation approach could not be determined"
  ]
